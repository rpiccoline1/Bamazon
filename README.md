The app starts with asking the user a simple yes or no question regarding if they would like to shop.  

If they choose no they will be given a message and the connection to the app will end.  If the user chooses yes then the app will run a function to bring up the whole inventory available.  

The user can then type in the item ID associated with the product they wish to purchase.  This will bring up a prompt requesting the use to choose how many of the item they wish to purchase.  

Once the item and quantity have been chosen the app will give the final cost and remove the quantity amount from the database.  

Finally the user will be prompted if they want to continue shopping or not.  If yes, the app will restart.  If no, the app connection will be disconnected.
